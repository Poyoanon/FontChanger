## How to Use]
- **[Download FontChanger here.](https://github.com/Poyoanon/FontChanger/releases)**
- Run `FontChanger.exe`.
- Make sure the fonts you have are in `.ttf` format.
- Select a font for **titles** when prompted. This is used for damage fonts, and important titles in the game.
- Select a font for **normal text** when prompted. This is used for dialogue and reading text.
- The program will process the fonts and generate `font_mod.lpk`. 
- Place `font_mod.lpk` in the `EFGame` folder where Lost Ark is located and rename it to `font.lpk`.
- Once complete, the modified font file will be ready to use in the game.
